- `CommonML` allows you to build OCaml programs on `CommonJS/package.json`.  If
  you know `CommonJS/package.json`, there's not much to learn.
- Dependencies are installed to the standard local directory `node_modules`
  sandbox.
- Your project (and dependencies) are automatically built in the correct order,
  into a local artifact directory.
- All of your dependencies' `"exports"` are automatically namespaced via the
  package name. If your `package.json` has two dependencies (`Package1` and
  `Package2`), and each exports a `Util` module, `CommonML` automatically
  generates module aliases that requires you to refer to them as
  `Package1.Util` and `Package2.Util`.  Internal modules within `Package1` and
  `Package2` may reference their internal util module via `Util` (without
  namespace).
- Developing/depending on local packages is the same as developing against
  remote dependencies. (Just use the standard `npm link` command).

>> This is merely an experiment that explores an OCaml based compilation
workflow based on the familiar `CommonJS`. `OPAM` is the official, high
performance package manager for OCaml and you should use that instead of this
project for real development.  This is only intended for people who really want
to try out OCaml development with their familiar `CommonJS`
workflow/namespacing.


**Automatically generates autocomplete for dependencies**

Note: `npm` is a hosting service, in *addition* to a command line interface to `CommonJS/package.json`.
You can use only the command line tools and host your dependencies at arbitrary
git URLS (a reason why `CommonJS` is great). Nothing stops you from hosting
OCaml code on `npm`'s hosted service too. The `npm` command line is just a tool for
installing files on your disk.

Requirements
------------
- *Very* new version of nodeJS http://nodejs.org
- OCaml: Just install `OPAM` which installs OCaml too: http://opam.ocaml.org/doc/Install.html


If you already know `CommonJS`, you already know `CommonML`. Most of this `README`
is just a basic tutorial on `package.json`/`npm`.


00. Try Building an Example Project!
---------------
In `ExampleProjects/MyProject/` there is an example project (which just means
a `src/` directory with OCaml files and a `package.json` listing its dependencies).
Check out the `package.json` file to see that it depends on a couple of other
`CommonML` projects that are hosted on github (not npm's service).

    # Install the project's dependencies.
    cd ./ExampleProjects/MyProject/
    npm install   #Installs dependencies.

    # Build and Run
    node node_modules/CommonML/build.js
    ./_build_byte/MyProject/myProject.out

    # If you have OCaml's Vim/Emacs Merlin plugin installed, editing
    # any of the example files will now have working autocomplete.



1. Make A Package From Scratch:
-----------------

To make your own package just like the example:

    #1. Make a directory with a `package.json` file and list any modules
    # that should be visible to *other* packages in the "exports" field.

    mkdir MyProject && cd MyProject
    echo '{
      "name": "MyProject",
      "dependencies": {"CommonML": "git://github.com/jordwalke/CommonML.git"},
      "CommonML": {
        "exports": ["MyPublicModule"],
        "compileFlags": [],
        "linkFlags": []
      }
    }' >> ./package.json

    #2. Downloads dependencies including `CommonML` into `./node_modules`
    npm install

    #3. Place all your package's `.ml` files inside of a directly named `src/`.
    mkdir ./src         # All .ml/.mli source files go here.
    echo 'let _ = print_string "Hello World"' >> src/MyPublicModule.ml

    #4. Build native executable
    node node_modules/CommonML/build.js

    #5. Run executable
    ./_build_byte/MyProject/myProject.out


2. Building
-----------------------------

- All `CommonML` dependencies automatically built in the correct order.
- Every `CommonML` package now contains an autogenerated `.merlin` file for
  code-completion.
- Source directories free of build artifacts, mirrored into `MyProject/_build_byte`.
- Executable output for topmost project placed into `MyProject/_build_byte/MyProject/myProject.out`.

4. Depend On Other Packages
---------------------------
Depending on other `CommonML` packages is done exactly the same way as adding
any other `npm` dependencies.

1. Add any other valid `CommonML` packages to `dependencies`
2. Now your `package.json` looks like Figure 1 below.
3. Rerun `npm install`. This installs all dependencies into `node_modules`.
4. Now your package's source files can simply refer to `SomeOtherPackage.TheirExportedModules.blah`.




Figure 1:


      "dependencies": {
         "CommonML": "git://github.com/jordwalke/CommonML.git",
         "SomeOtherPackage: "git://github.com/jordwalke/SomeOtherPackage.git"
       },


Sharing:
-------

  1. Just push your `package.json` and `src/` directory to any git URL.
  2. Other people may point to *that* git URL in *their* package.json's dependencies.
  3. Other people just run `npm install` and your package will be installed into *their* `node_modules` sandbox.

Resolving Duplicate Packages:
----------------------------
Duplicate modules are namespaced automatically, but duplicate packages can only be resolved
by the package manager - `npm`.
If two packages depend on two different versions of the same module - there is no solution yet.
If two packages depend on *compatible* versions of the same module, then `npm dedupe` should take care of it.

Build Parameters:
-----------------

Dedicated build directories (with their own resource caches) are created for
each build flag combination. For example, if you build a root project
`YourProject` "for debugging", with `native` compilation, then the resulting
binary is placed at
`RootOfYourProject/_build_native_debug/YourProject/yourProject.out` and
intermediate build artifacts for dependencies are placed at
`RootOfYourProject/_build_native_debug/ADependency/...`.


*Build bytecode (default):(From `YourProject` root)*

    node node_modules/CommonML/build.js --compiler=byte # To compile bytecode

    # Then run
    ./_build_byte/YourProject/yourProject.out


*Build native binaries:(From `YourProject` root)*

    node node_modules/CommonML/build.js --compiler=native # To compile to native binaries

    # Then run
    ./_build_native/YourProject/yourProject.out


*Preprocess all `.mly/mll` for `yacc` and `lex`*

    # See example project TAPLArith
    node node_modules/CommonML/build.js --compiler=byte --yacc=true


*To enable stack traces:(From `YourProject` root)*

    # Your binary and dependencies must be compiled with --forDebug
    node node_modules/CommonML/build.js --forDebug=true
    # You must have a runtime parameter set
    export OCAMLRUNPARAM='b'
    # Execute the binary that was built into the dedicated directory
    ./_build_blah_blah/YourProject/yourProject.out


*Build JavaScript With Sourcemaps:(From `YourProject` root)*

    # Building JavaScript is a special case of building for debug, and building
    # for bytecode (a final step converts the bytecode to JavaScript).
    # Ensure you have `js_of_ocaml` installed and available on your PATH.
    # Install via `opam install js_of_ocaml`.
    node node_modules/CommonML/build.js --forDebug=true --jsCompile=true
    # open a test html page that includes `./jsBuild/app.js'



Customizing JavaScript Build Location And Running With Server
----------------------------

`--jsCompile` will generate two artifacts: The symlink (`jsBuild`) to the
actual js bundle and source maps and a fake directory structure to get
source maps to work when served from a web server.

When building for JS, the root package's `package.json`'s
`CommonML.jsPlaceBuildArtifactsIn` field will determine where the js build
artifacts will be placed. It is considered relative to package root.  If not
specified, it will default to the package root itself.

When running locally, source maps naturally work correctly because they
specify absolute file paths to original source files. But when serving that
web server root from a web server, the same origin policy restricts you
from seeing the source maps. So (unfortunately) `CommonML` has to pollute
that destination `jsPlaceBuildArtifactsIn` with a faked directory path that
resembles the absolute path to where your original source files were
located so that source maps will work even when running on a web server.
You will see a generated path that symlinks to your original build
directory, such as:


    YourProject/myJsPlaceBuildArtifactsIn/Users/yourName/path/to/YourProject/_build_byte_debug ->  YourProject/_build_byte_debug/


This is just so that when you run a web server at
`YourProject/myJsPlaceBuildArtifactsIn` (or whatever you configured
`jsPlaceBuildArtifactsIn`) source maps will work correctly.



Integrating With JavaScript:
----------------------------

When you build for JavaScript `--forDebug=true --jsCompile=true`, you are
simply compiling into JS. This doesn't give you the ability to do anything
except print output. To actually interface with the containing JavaScript
environment, you'll need to not only *compile* using `js_of_ocaml`, but also
use the `js_of_ocaml` runtime libraries which should be compiled into
JavaScript along with your application code. To ensure that it is included, and
linked, add `js_of_ocaml` to your `package.json` file's
`CommonML.findlibPackages` field.  (There's also a syntax extension available
to make interacting with JavaScript more sugary).


    "CommonML": {
      "findlibPackages": [{"dependency": "js_of_ocaml"}],


You can also include a field in your `package.json`'s `CommonML` section called
`jsResources`. This may be set to a directory (relative to your project's root)
whos contents should be copied into the js build directory. A generated
`app.js` file will also be generated by `js_of_ocaml` and placed alongside
them. See `ExampleProjects/MyProject/`.


    "CommonML": {
      "jsResources": "jsResourcesDir",


`CommonML` ensures that source maps work whether or not you serve your files
from a web server, or from local disk. It does this by creating the appropriate
sym links that your browser's source maps will understand.

Compatibility:
-------------

  1. CommonML is opinionated and only builds packages of a certain form.
  2. See the documentation for more details.
  3. Each package lists all of its dependencies in its package.json.
  4. CommonML ensures that each of your dependency\' packages are accessible
     and build before your package.
  5. Each of your dependencies must also be CommonML compatible.

Why NPM?:
--------

  1. npm (command line tool, that CommonML uses) is *not* npmjs.com (service).
  2. npm (command line tool) is merely a way to organize and install dependencies - it has nothing to do with JS.
  3. npm do not depend on any central repository and is extremely popular.
  4. npm (and therefore CommonML) can work entirely based on github repos.
  5. npm allows local development as a special case of sharing (see `npm link`)


Package Structure
-----------------

Any set of files/directories that have the following form are a valid CommonML
project. To make a CommonML project, just make these files with the following:

- Root project directory that matches the name of your project. In this case
  `MyProject`.
- A `src` directory that may contain any files, but may not contain two `.ml`
  files with the same file name.
- A `package.json` file directly inside of the project root directory (more on
  that later).


Typical project structure.

    └── MyProject/
        ├── package.json
        └── src/
            ├── moduleOne.mli
            ├── moduleOne.ml
            └── someDirectory/
                └── someOtherModule.ml


Recall that in OCaml, a file named `foo.ml` automatically becomes a module
`Foo`. The only question is, which modules can see other modules? CommonML
comes up with a reasonable convention that makes sharing easy.

Suppose you hae a package root directory named `YourProject/`
- The module located at `YourProject/src/any_path/moduleX.ml` can access
  `YourProject/src/any_other_path/moduleY.ml` simply by typing `ModuleY`. The
  file paths don't effect visibility *within* a package.
- Therefore no two OCaml files inside of `YourProject/src` may have the same
  name -> no two OCaml modules inside of `YourProject/src` may have the same
  name.
- `YourProject` package allows other dependent packages to reference internal
  module `YourInternalModule` if and only if `YourInternalModule` name is
  listed in `YourProject`'s `package.json` (`CommonML.exports` field).

The `package.json`:
-------------------

Each package's `package.json` must provide information that instructs CommonML
how to compile, run, and be depended on by other packages.

    {
      "name": "MyProject",
      "version": "1.0",
      "description": "Simple My Project example in OCaml",
      "dependencies": {
        "CommonML": "ssh+git://github.com/jordwalke/CommonML.git",
        "YourProject": "1.0"
      },
      "CommonML": {
        "exports": ["ExportedModule", "AnotherExportedModuleName"],
        "compileFlags": ["-g", "-w","-30","-w","-40"],
        "findlibPackages": [
          {"dependency": "comparelib"},
          {"syntax": "comparelib.syntax"}
        ]
      }
    }


- There is also a place to put compiler flags and `findlibPackages` in the
  `package.json`.


Use CommonML To Tame Local Development:
--------------------------------------

You can use the familiar `npm link` command to have projects depend on other
projects locally without publishing them publicly.

Goals:
======

- Local development should be the same exact workflow as sharing and depending
  on published modules. Local development is merely sharing with yourself.

- No `README` should ever contain the phrase: "Make sure you have package X
  installed globally on your system".

- Installing a package should *always* be as simple as listing it as a
  dependency in `package.json` and running `npm install`. It should install
  everything you need to be able to build, run and (eventually) generate
  documentation. This isn't always possible for huge projects, but `CommonML`
  is for the subset of projects for which it *is* possible.

*Yes, `CommonML` currently relies on having `OCaml/nodeJS` installed on your system.
One thing at a time.


FAQ:
===

Which module is the root of the executable? `CommonML`'s build script
automatically determines this by way of using `ocamldep` behind the scenes. In
short, it's whichever one does not have any other dependencies.



Preprocessors:
==================

You may supply a custom preprocessor program that should be executed on each
file in order to parse the source into a canonical AST. The preprocessor must be
available in your `PATH` and be able to accept an arbitrary file, and either
invoke a custom parser, or invoke the standard parser. Your preprocessor likely
would use file extensions as "hints" as to which to do.

Therefore, `CommonML` also allows you to indicate that particular "pairs" of
extensions should be treated as interfaces/implementations respectively -
otherwise the file extension "hints" that are used by your preprocessor will
confuse the rest of the compilation toolchain.

You will often want to supply both a preprocessor *and* extensions. Below is an
example of doing both, by populating the `preprocessor` and `extensions` fields
in a `package.json`'s `CommonML` field:

      "CommonML": {
        "exports": ["MyProjectMod"],
        "preprocessor": "myCustomPreprocessor",
        "extensions": [{
          "interface": ".heyoi",
          "implementation": ".heyo"
        }],

The `preprocessor` and `extensions` fields are separate concepts that are often
used simultaneously.

TODO:
=====

  - Currently an "inconsistent interface" message can occur when an interface
    file does *not* exist for an implementation file. This happens because the
    arguments to a compilation command does not include an interface for obvious
    reasons, yet there is an *automatically* generated interface cmi sitting in
    the build directory. That cmi could be an *outdated* cmi. If there was a
    real existing interface file, the cmi would get overwritten by a fresh,
    non-conflicting build artifact. The quick solution is to remove all .cmi's
    for every implementation that does not have a corresponding interface file.
    (Or even more generally, remove all the artifacts that we didn't
    *explicitly* supply as an output.).
  - Replicate this development flow with OPAM/ocamlbuild to see how
    close we can get.
  - Different configurable compiler flags for `byte` vs `native`.
  - Warn when observing .ml/i files outside of `src` directory.
  - Build `CommonML` compatible packages from OPAM.
  - Generate ocamldebug startup script for last dependency seen in ocamldep,
    set to break on the first line.
  - An `a.out` is generated by `ocamlfind` when it shouldn't be: `ocamlfind
    ocamlc -linkpkg -package js_of_ocaml -only-show` is supposed to find
    transitive dependencies, but only show without compiling, but it compiles
    and generates a left-over `a.out`. This is easily reproducable.
  - The `--forDebug` flag should be examined to determine if the optimized js
    compilation should be used (and source maps omitted).
  - Find a better solution for sourcemaps than creating fake directory
    structures and/or have `js_of_ocaml` just inline the source contents into
    the sourcemaps so we don't have to deal with file paths at all.
  - `js_of_ocaml` should itself be turned into a `CommonML` dependency to
    remove any need to use the `findlibPackages` field (it's confusing that we
    even have the notion of "findlib packages") and `package.json` is fully
    sufficient to do everything we need. This is only temporary.
